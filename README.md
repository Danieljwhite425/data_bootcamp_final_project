Project Description

It's well-known that it's difficult for startups and small businesses to survive. [In 2018, there were 30.2 million small businesses operating in the U.S.](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Whats-New-With-Small-Business-2018.pdf) It's estimated that only [2 in 5 of those businesses are profitable, while the others breakeven or even lose money.](https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/03/startup-statistics-small-business.html) Experts and investors look to a variety of factors to try and predict the outcome of a startup, ranging from [the founder's gender](https://hbr.org/2016/05/4-factors-that-predict-startup-success-and-one-that-doesnt) to [the influence of venture capitalists](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/113149/1018306746-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). In this project, we look at about 50,000 companies listed on Crunchbase to examine the effect of funding on startup outcome and try to predict the probability that a startup is acquired (or still operating).
